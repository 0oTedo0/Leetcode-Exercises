## Task

[232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)


## Problem

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (``push``, ``peek``
, ``pop``, and ``empty``).

Implement the ``MyQueue`` class:

* ``void push(int x)`` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
* ``int pop()`` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
* ``int peek()`` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
* ``boolean empty()`` Returns ``true`` if the queue is empty, ``false`` otherwise.

### Notes

* You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only ``push to top``, ``peek/pop from top``, ``size``, and ``is empty`` operations are valid.
* Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

### Follow-up

Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **amortized** ``O(1)`` time complexity? In other words, 
performing n operations will take overall ``O(n)`` time even if one of those operations may take longer.

### Example 1
```
Input
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]

Output
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]

Explanation
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= ``x`` <= 9
* At most ``100``Â calls will be made to ``push``, ``pop``, ``peek``, and ``empty``.
* All the calls to ``pop`` and ``peek`` are valid.

## Solution

### Idea
Treat one stack as **input** stack and treat the other stack as **output** stack.

Pop from **input** to **output** only when output stack is empty. The order of **output** stack is just the order of **queue**.

# Solution

## Task

[90. Subsets II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/subsets-ii/)

## Problem

Given an integer array ``nums`` that may contain duplicates, return *all possible subsets (the power set)*.

The solution set **must not** contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]
```

### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]
```

### Constraints

* 1 <= ``nums.length`` <= 10
* -10 <= ``nums[i]`` <= 10

## Solution

### Idea
**Backtrack DFS**

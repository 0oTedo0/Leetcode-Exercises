## Task

[1. Two Sum](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/two-sum/)


## Problem

Given an array of integers ``nums``Â and an integer ``target``, return *indices* of the two numbers such that they add up to ``target``.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

### Example 3

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

### Constraints

* 2 <= ``nums.length`` <= 103
* -109 <= ``nums[i]`` <= 109
* -109 <= ``target`` <= 109
* Only one valid answer exists.

## Solution

### Idea
Use **Dictionary** to solve this problem.

**Dictionary** enables query to become ``O(1)``.

## Task

[2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)


## Problem

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sumÂ as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example 1
<img width="450" height="300" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/addtwonumber1.jpg"/>

```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

### Example 3

```
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

### Constraints

* The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range ``[1, 100]``.
* 0 <= ``Node.val`` <= 9
* It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

## Solution

### Idea
Create a list while taking care of carry.
